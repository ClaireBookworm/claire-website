# Mcflurry-Hedgehog

*a poem I found in the deep pits of my google drive*

in the large central park of lush green  
chunks of polystyrene  
I see a museum widely hailed  
yet the main exhibit is dead animal tales  
i sigh and turn for a mcdonalds  
but all I can see is the mcflurry-  
hedgehog.  
a famous hedgehog stuck in a cap of my favorite concoction  
the exhibit card writes:  
"hedgehogs die from starvation or blindly walk into water  
and drown"  
so they're right  
curiosity did kill the cat.  

  

When the tissue blew across the room\
I found speckles of black dust—\
gritty, crusty, musty dust—\
shaking the tissue everything fell out\
a cupcake-scented pencil lost two years ago\
my post-it kits of bits\
all lit up on the floor—\
speckles of black gray orbs—\
dust.  



I ask to turn on the heat because i'm always cold.\
A shivering, teeth-chattering cold.\
But my mom just laughs and says\
"what? it's so warm!\
look at all the bees swarm.\
you're in los angeles, not some east coast mess"\
Toto, we're not in texas anymore\
but my cold feet tell me otherwise.  

  
  

In the ‘demic I can hardly stomach  
The spikes and stones in my food  
I crunch and they taste like dust.  
Dust is everywhere–  
In my lungs, heart, face, nose–  
I can only scream silently as dust fills my mouth.  
*Sometimes it is not mites that make us*  
*But the discomfort we feel within.*  
*A bubblingmubblingdtumbling feeling rolls in my stomach*  
*and I can hardly stomach my anxiety*  
*swallow my panic*  
*What!? Hide my tears?*  
*I know not how.*  



A dread builds   
Like that dread you felt when you hear stomping on the stairs  
A dread from when the sun will fall and it will be dark  
I sometimes dread the pillow or couch for fear I’ll fall asleep  
and miss happenstances.  
We dredge up emotions and bury the dread  
and force our molars to all the world to see  
and trees bend down to our smile.
