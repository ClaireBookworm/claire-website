This is what [Ed Boyden](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/ed-boyden/), my PI, sent me after we talked about on required courses to learn that would be akin / equal to a degree useful for good science research (not quite specific to just neuroscience). He called it: "The 'dropout curriculum' for becoming a great bioengineer rapidly. " 

## Required Courses
He called this list of MIT courses the *bare minimum*. Course numbers are old ones, I think some of the Course 6 ones have changed around at this point. 

*Chemistry*:
- 5.11 Principles of Chemical Science
- 5.12 Organic Chemistry I
- 5.60 Thermodynamics and Kinetics

*Biology*:
- 7.012 Introductory Biology

*Physics*:
- 8.01 Physics I
- 8.02 Physics II
- 8.03 Physics III
- 8.04 Quantum Mechanics I
- 8.05 Quantum Mechanics II (if you want!)

*Calculus*:
- 18.01 Calculus
- 18.02 Calculus II
- 18.03 Differential Equations
- 18.06 Linear Algebra

*Computer Science*:
- 6.003 Signals and Systems
- 6.042 Math for Computer Science
- 8.044 Statistical Mechanics I
- 6.011 Comm., Control, and Signal Processing

*Neuroscience*:
- 9.00 Introduction to Psychology
- 9.641 Introduction to Neural Networks

You can find content for all of these courses on MIT OpenCourseWare.

**Note**: Maybe his full list of courses he ended up taking might be useful?? Unsure lol. Anyways, this list is kind of what I'm planning on using as a way to figure out what to self-study and what to take.
